Story Pitch
A) What is the story you intend to tell/visualize (Thao)
Happiness is regarded as the most important emotion for human beings and it attracts more attention from people especially after COVID-19. The pandemic has changed the world and people's pace of life has gradually become slower. Therefore, our team decided to analyze how the happiness index of countries changed before (2015 to 2019), during (2020 - 2022), and after the pandemic (2023). Our analysis will be based on criterias: freedom, life expectancy, economy, social support, standard error and freedom to make life choices. We will estimate that with those the same categories during 2015 to 2023, does the happiness score remain or change and also the happiness rankings among countries are affected or not. 
About the visualization, my team intends to use a column chart, bar chart, and world map. Firstly, for the column chart, we will compare the happiness values of the top 5 happiest countries between 3 periods of time: before, during, and after COVID. In the horizontal axis, it is the axis for 5 country names and there will be 3 columns in each country which represent for the 3 different periods of time. For the vertical axis, it will contain the happiness values. This graph will show how COVID-19 affected the top 5 happiest countries and whether rankings change or not. Next, regarding the bar charts, we will show the happiness score of the top 50 countries by using a movable selection for users to interact with our website. In that selection tool, it will have 9 points which represent for 9 years (2015 to 2023) and users can pull the mouse up or down to fit with the year that they want to see the happiness score of 50 countries in that chosen year. And whenever the selection tool is being pulled, the bar chart will also change due to the users. From this chart, we can see that the top 50 countries change much about their happiness scores during 9 years, especially during 2020 - 2022 when the COVID-19 occurred. Lastly, our team will do a world map. For this kind of visualization, people will be able to see the happiness score of all countries in the world in 2023. There are 6 different colors representing 6 different levels of happiness score from lowest to highest. This will be represented in the world map and users can interact with it by clicking to a particular country or color that they see on the map, our website will automatically pop up the country name and also the happiness score of the option that they choose. 

B) Why that is an interesting and compelling story (Hyein)
Covid-19 pandemic was a unique and unprecedented event in modern history. Exploration of global happiness levels before and after impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is a compelling topic for several reasons. The fact that people across the world experienced this period, readers are able to gain an immediate understanding of how the pandemic reshaped the world's emotional landscape by visualizing data. From late 2019 to the middle of 2023, the Covid-19 pandemic brought a series of profound transformations to people. Daily life was uncomfort due to unprecedented restrictions, including limitations on outdoor activities, constraints on social interactions, and the obligatory wearing of masks. These changes, imposed social distance and sanitizing, carried immense consequences and sacrifices. One of the most poignant aspects of this pandemic phenomenon is the fact that a substantial portion of the world's population encountered Covid-19 in one form or another within a three years. The data imply the pandemic disrupted the feelings of joy, a sense of purpose in life, and overall life satisfaction. In addition, this result can give a chance to inform future strategies for mental health support and well-being interventions. Furthermore, by identifying the specific factors that contributed to changes in happiness levels, we can tailor support systems to address the unique challenges posed by similar global crises.Comparing world happiness before and after the pandemic becomes captivating as it provides insights into the shared people’s experience of navigating a transformative and profoundly challenging period in history.

Background Research/ Inspiration
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/20/covid-not-affected-happiness-around-world-study (Thao)
After Covid, this article announces that people around the world seem to be happier than previously. The two main reasons are people had more time to connect with their surroundings such as family or neighbors. This helps them to feel more connected and engaging with the community. Besides, people also felt that they received more positive social support from the government which enhanced their trust and reliability.
“Interviews with more than 100,000 people across 137 countries found significantly higher levels of benevolence in all global regions than before the pandemic. And when asked to evaluate their lives on a scale of one to 10, people on average gave scores just as high in the 2020-22 Covid years as in 2017-19.” (The Guardian). Based on the real data, it is true that people seem to be normal or even happier than the period before COVID.

This article shows that during Covid, the young are less satisfied than the middle-aged, who are less satisfied than the old. The reason is that compared to previously, old people’ family seem to be too busy with their own life and work and they did not have much time to get in touch with their parents or grandparents. But since COVID-19, when everything was locked down, people stayed at home and they had more time together. If they lived far from each other, they still called more often to the old people than previously according to the share of participation from the article. Contrast with the old people, the young ones seem to be less excited because that was the time many of them lost their jobs which created a huge pressure and difficulty. Besides, they are the generation that prefer staying out and since the pandemic, they could not get outside and hang out with their friends which also limited their social life and caused stress. 
Moreover, some countries have fared better than others during COVID. Whereas Britons’ happiness slumped in 2020, Germany rose from being the 15th happiest country in the world to the seventh happiest. This illustrates that the happiness ranking can be changed after the occurrence of COVID.

This article gives a prediction of world happiness after COVID-19 and it was published in 2020. It was written based on the sharing and opinions from 6 guest speakers and the majority of them illustrated that the pandemic has affected negatively every aspect of human life. Therefore, their forecast for the world happiness score post-pandemic will be lower than previously. 
However, based on the data and articles we have collected, it seems to be quite the opposite. It shows that people are quite normal after COVID-19 and the happiness scores calculated in all countries are not much variable.

This article reports a happy and unhappy regime using a model. In 2019 (before pandemic) “happy” was prevailing, but in 2020, “unhappy” increased frequently and it assumes unhappiness is from pandemic events. 
On the other hand, the decrease of happiness level was due to a lockdown which was decided by the government. Because of the lockdown during the pandemic, people lost their jobs and could not travel internationally.

This talk about pandemic made people less happier than before. Moreover, people forgot what true happiness is during the pandemic years. Young Americans had mental health problems and adults felt severe loneliness. 
People began to spend more money, thinking paying can fulfill their happiness by shopping. However, some people forgot what they bought.
